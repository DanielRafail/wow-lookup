- VERIFY ERROR MESSAGES WITH WRONG APIS

- ADD IMAGES TO PVP

- ADD VALID INFORMATION TO FOOTER

- PUT LOADING SYMBOL WHILE APIS ARE BEING CALLED

- DISPLAY ERROR NUMBER WHEN ERRORS OCCUR? (displayed in console so does it matter?)

- FIX UGLY UI

- ADD BACKEND WITH .ENV TO HOLD HIDDEN KEYS 

- MAYBE PHONE FRIENDLY? (not priority)

- MAYBE I18N (not priority, option would be a dropdown in footer)
