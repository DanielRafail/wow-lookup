			ALPHA RELEASE UNSURE FIX
====================================================================

1 - API CALL FOR CHAR INFO ON INDEX PAGE AND GIVE THAT TO SUMMARY SO I DONT HAVE TO DO API CALL WITHIN
    PVP API CALL FOR THAT INFO

1 - Error if player has no logs history (Scarybino-area52/dumbbells-illidan)


====================================================================
			NOT ALPHA RELEASE
====================================================================


1 - MAYBE SHOW PREVIOUS RAID TIERS (NOT PART OF ALPHA RELEASE)
- would have to call Blizz API to get journal index, find latest xpac journal id
- call journals with it, then iterate through all of its ids and call 
- wowlogs with them


4 - Maybe add languages to footer (NOT PART OF ALPHA RELEASE)

10 - Maybe phone friendly? (NOT PART OF ALPHA RELEASE) (not priority)

11 - Maybe I18N (NOT PART OF ALPHA RELEASE) 
(not priority, option would be a dropdown in footer)

NUMBER = PRIORITY
