# WoW-Lookup

## What is it?

WoW-Lookup is a website used to look up all details about a player! Instead of having to open wowlogs, raider.io, or checkpvp seperately, gather all your information here in one simple interface. It is a passion product slowly underway, done for fun. Comments for future changes are welcome. 

### Veto a player correctly ;)
